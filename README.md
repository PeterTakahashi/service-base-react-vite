# ðŸš€ FastAPI Auth Starter Kit â€” Google & GitHub OAuth + React

This is a starter project for building an AI web service with FastAPI and React.

If you're using the [fastapi-users](https://github.com/fastapi-users/fastapi-users) library for authentication, you'll find there's a lot to set up: configuring APIs, setting up Google and GitHub OAuth, adding tests with pytest, setting up a code linter, and more. It can take a lot of time.

And if you rely too much on LLM-generated code, the result is often insecure and messy.

So I created this project to save you time and give you a clean starting point.
